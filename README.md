With the growing number of vehicles on the road, there is a critical need for intelligent traffic management and monitoring systems to improve road safety, reduce congestion, and enhance traffic flow. This project aims to automate the process of detecting and tracking vehicles in video frames using computer vision techniques, providing a foundation for various applications such as traffic monitoring, surveillance, and automated toll systems.
