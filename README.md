With the growing number of vehicles on the road, there is a critical need for intelligent traffic management and monitoring systems to improve road safety, reduce congestion, and enhance traffic flow. Traditional methods of vehicle detection and monitoring can be labor-intensive and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the process of detecting and tracking vehicles in video frames using computer vision techniques, providing a foundation for various applications such as traffic monitoring, surveillance, and automated toll systems.
